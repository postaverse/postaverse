## Inspiration
I bought the postaverse.net domain after spending all of December 2023 building the original site from scratch. 700+ lines of python code, all the CSS/JS/HTML. v1 was retired in March and I didn't start making v2 until May, which brought infinitely better looks. Most of the Postaverse v1 code (maybe about 300-400 lines of code) came from me, my broken arm, and my COVID in December of 2023.

In December 2023, I was in the process of wrapping up Harvard's free online Computer Science course, CS50x, while using Python and Flask to create a dynamic website for displaying birthday's. As a final project for CS50x, I created a basic chat app, which eventually led me to create Postaverse with the former co-founder Triston.
